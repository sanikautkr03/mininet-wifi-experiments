# Mininet-WiFi Experiments

This repository contains a collection of wireless networking experiments using [Mininet-WiFi](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi). These experiments simulate mobile stations, handover mechanisms, and web server performance in wireless topologies.

Additionally, this project uses the [POX SDN controller](https://github.com/noxrepo/pox) for managing handover logic and flow control in certain experiments.
